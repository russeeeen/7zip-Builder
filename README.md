Exploiting 7-zip

Usage:

python exploity.py
python3 exploity.py

The bug can only be exploited when 7-Zip is ran with Admin privileges for this vulnerability to be succesfully exploited.
This is because it the 7-zip process creates a symlink, which is a privileged operation on windows.

This is a GUI version.
